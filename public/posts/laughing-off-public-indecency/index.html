Trigger Warning: Slightly Too Much Info Story Ahead
I’ve got a story that’s been sitting on the back burner lately. My cousin, Kuya Ken, invited me over to Sheraton Cebu Mactan Resort. He called me when I was just in the middle of my immediate resignation at Amazon Cebu. Since I had nothing going on at the time after resigning, I promptly got an Angkas to Mactan." />

<h2 id="trigger-warning-slightly-too-much-info-story-ahead">Trigger Warning: Slightly Too Much Info Story Ahead</h2>
<p>I’ve got a story that’s been sitting on the back burner lately. My cousin, <strong>Kuya Ken</strong>, invited me over to <strong>Sheraton Cebu Mactan Resort</strong>. He called me when I was just in the middle of my <strong>immediate resignation at Amazon Cebu</strong>. Since I had nothing going on at the time after resigning, I promptly got an <strong>Angkas</strong> to Mactan.</p>
<p>I’ve already shared the bulk of the stay on Instagram/Facebook back then, but what I left was the interesting part. We were at <strong>Savemore nearest Mactan airport</strong> because Kuya Ken wanted to buy <strong>pasalubong</strong> for relatives in Davao.</p>
<p>While we were at it, I got the urge to pee and asked Kuya Ken to wait with all the stuff at the <strong>pasalubong aisle</strong>. I asked for directions and quickly found it. As soon as I entered, I saw a man on the left urinal, so I went to the right urinal next to him since there was no third urinal in between.</p>
<p>From what I understood about the <strong>unspoken rules of peeing in the men’s CR</strong> is that one goes in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pees</li>
<li>Jiggles the pee out (<em>Remember: &ldquo;If you jiggle it more than 3 times, you&rsquo;re playing with it.&rdquo;)</em></li>
<li>Washes your hands afterward</li>
<li>Looks into the mirror</li>
<li>Dries your wet hands with your pants</li>
<li>Uses the remaining moisture on your hair</li>
<li>Winks at yourself</li>
<li>Does the finger guns</li>
<li>Gets out</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be a <strong>30-second to 1-minute affair</strong>. Eyes at your pecker while peeing, and no wandering eyes. If you’re unsure what to do, staring at the wall in front of you is a safe thing to do. <strong>Anything that deviates from that will give you unusual looks.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t make the rules.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, from my peripheral vision, the other guy was doing something weird. <strong>Grunting and doing something weird with his penis.</strong> I thought he got it stuck on his pant zipper or maybe had kidney stones and therefore had trouble peeing properly. I didn’t look since it would deviate from what I understood to be the <strong>rules of manhood</strong>.</p>
<p>Once I was finished with my business, I washed my hands and saw the guy in the mirror’s reflection and didn’t think anything else about it.</p>
<p>Back to the <strong>pasalubong aisle</strong>, my cousin also had the urge to pee, so we switched places. I gave him instructions, reassured him I wouldn’t leave his baggage with his important documents, and then waved him away.</p>
<p>Around <strong>5 minutes</strong> after using the restroom, I found <strong>Kuya Ken with a face like he’d seen a ghost.</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: <strong>I totally missed it!</strong> I was just focused on the task at hand, completely oblivious to the situation next door.</p>
<p>Turns out, <strong>the guy next to him in the restroom wasn’t exactly&hellip; &ldquo;following the unwritten rules.&rdquo;</strong> Let’s just say the guy was expressing himself <strong>a little differently</strong> than expected.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conversation-in-bisaya">Conversation in Bisaya:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kuya Ken:</strong> <em>Ko, kita ka atong lalake sa CR?</em><br>
(<em>Miko, did you see that guy in the CR?</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Kato siya na dugay gapangihi? Naa pa siya diadto?</em><br>
(<em>The guy that’s been peeing for way too long? He’s still there?</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Kuya Ken:</strong> <em>O, wala man to nangihi, wala man ka nagsaba na naay ga lo lo!?</em><br>
(<em>Yes, he wasn’t peeing actually. Why didn’t you say that he was masturbating?!</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Ha, wala ko kabalo na ga inadto man diay siya. Murag ra man siya ug ga pass ug kidney stones.</em><br>
(<em>What? I didn’t know that he was doing that. He looked at me as though he was passing kidney stones.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Kuya Ken:</strong> <em>Ahak, lami kaayo ingnan ‘Naunsa diay ka bay’?!</em><br>
(<em>Damn, I wanted to say to him, “What the f</em>** is wrong with you?!”*)</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>He had a lot more <strong>raunchy things to say</strong>, but I don’t want this post to be as explicit as it could be. The <strong>gist</strong> was that he was <strong>trauma-dumping in the guise of us laughing it off</strong>. I was already <strong>nearing a year in Cebu</strong> and I was <strong>numb</strong> with how they <strong>leave their mental cases naked in public</strong>, so it <strong>didn’t faze me as it should</strong>.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be so sure about my cousin, and that’s <strong>his side of the story</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The guy might’ve been on <strong>drugs</strong> and wasn’t aware of his surroundings. The guy might’ve <strong>known we were there</strong> and got his rocks off (<em>not kidney stones&hellip; haha</em>) based on that fact. <strong>I don’t know really. It’s just a bunch of maybes.</strong></p>
<p>And my cousin was asking <strong>why I didn’t give him a heads-up.</strong></p>
<p>We <strong>tried</strong> to give a heads-up to the <strong>cashier/bagger</strong>, but it sounded weird as we were saying it, so <strong>we didn’t press into it as we should’ve.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>guard?</strong> Couldn’t even tell us straight that <strong>Savemore is the Pasalubong Centre on Google Maps</strong>.</p>
<p>I mean, <strong>we should’ve</strong>, but <strong>what’s the timeline of having to be witnesses for a sex deviant’s public masturbation criminal case?</strong> My cousin’s got a <strong>plane to catch.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="kidding-aside">Kidding aside&hellip;</h3>
<p><strong>What would you have done in this situation?</strong></p>
<p>Would you have given your cousin a <strong>heads-up</strong>, or just <strong>kept it moving like me?</strong></p>
<p>(<em>Assuming that you would&rsquo;ve also looked into the other guy&rsquo;s business.</em>)</p>
