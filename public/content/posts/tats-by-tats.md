On a Reddit post on **r/Tagalog** (Vocabulary/Terminology) by user **u/montanoj88**:

> *"What is the equivalent word for "jakol" for women?"*  
>  
> *I know 'sariling sikap' is applicable but is there a more specific word if the 'nagsasariling sikap' is a woman? In English, I think the equivalent word is 'jilling'. Trying to translate a story kasi. Sorry, r/tagalog admin if this is bastos, I'll understand if the post is deleted. But please don't ban me :-) Thank you."*

I replied:  

**Tats**  

*"I'll touch myself nalang."*
