There was this now deleted Reddit post in r/Cebu asking, &ldquo;To those diagnosed with ADHD - how was your experience?&rdquo; and here was my take on it.

There&rsquo;s this thing on Instagram Reels called AuDHD (Autism/ADHD), and I relate to most of what they are saying. I knew something was wrong with me, and I was experiencing a lot at that time with my tech job in Cebu—limerence, seasonal depression, stress from toxic clients, anxiety, inability to concentrate (more than usual), malaise, etc. It&rsquo;s a good thing my company offers a refund for medical services. I asked my TM if psychological services were included, and I got the approval." />

<p>There was this now deleted Reddit post in r/Cebu asking, <em>&ldquo;To those diagnosed with ADHD - how was your experience?&rdquo;</em> and here was my take on it.</p>
<hr>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing on Instagram Reels called <em>AuDHD</em> (Autism/ADHD), and I relate to most of what they are saying. I knew something was wrong with me, and I was experiencing a lot at that time with my tech job in Cebu—limerence, seasonal depression, stress from toxic clients, anxiety, inability to concentrate (more than usual), malaise, etc. It&rsquo;s a good thing my company offers a refund for medical services. I asked my TM if psychological services were included, and I got the approval.</p>
<p>So, I asked the local psychology association if they catered to Adult ADHD tests, and they referred me to Gestalt Wellness, located at Velez Medical Arts. I took the test there and was given a formal diagnosis: I have adult ADHD, inattentive type (formerly known as ADD), and I was experiencing ADHD burnout. By the way, officially, I&rsquo;m not on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that my case was not severe, but that&rsquo;s because I had to learn how to mask the symptoms, develop self-coping strategies, and self-medicate (two cups of black coffee a day, armodafinil).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still self-medicating. I&rsquo;m a psychology student, and nootropics are not new to me. I tried ordering atomoxetine on Shopee, but the two stores I found were frozen, so I had to look elsewhere online. I chose atomoxetine (<em>Strattera</em>) because it&rsquo;s not a stimulant, and I didn&rsquo;t want to go to a psychiatrist for a ₱3,000 prescription for stimulants that cost around ₱290 per tablet. On a side note, I know stimulants have a bad reputation, but they simply activate the underactive parts of our ADHD brains (the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for high-level executive functioning). <em>I just didn&rsquo;t want to explain to my family why I&rsquo;m taking stimulants.</em> Atomoxetine costs around ₱90 per tablet, so like a good car mechanic, I started with the most cost-efficient option first.</p>
<p>I knew it would take about 30 days before atomoxetine&rsquo;s full effects would be felt, but I still remember the first time I took it. Around 30 minutes in, the brain fog started lifting. Simple tasks like washing dishes, cooking food, and ironing clothes were no longer <em>painful</em>. It felt like grease to the cogs in my brain. Of course, I still needed nutrients as fuel and coffee as <em>nitro</em>. It was no longer a grind. <em>And I say it&rsquo;s no longer painful because I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the task paralysis associated with inattentive-type ADHD.</em></p>
<p>I still take it every couple of days since, for me, the effects don&rsquo;t stack up—it would just be wasted if I took it daily. Mind you, I still need to meditate, be mindful of what to concentrate on, and decide what to work on. It&rsquo;s not an on/off switch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to go in person and get diagnosed. Your psychologist will have a better view of your symptoms. They will provide an official clinical diagnosis, both in paper and digital form. I&rsquo;ve been told that one can use it to apply for a Persons with Disability (PWD) ID, but I don’t want the hassle of explaining invisible disabilities to people right now.</p>
<p>The test cost around ₱3,200 and I had it refunded by my company. But more than that, it was a vindication—finally proving my hunches: that something was <em>wrong</em> with me and explaining why I consistently <em>self-sabotage</em> my relationships, career, and life. <em>And when I say self-sabotage, I mean constantly forgetting important (and non-important) things, having my attention stolen whenever I&rsquo;m engrossed in stimulating activities, getting irrationally angry when my hyperfocus is broken, derailing conversations with tangents, frequently changing jobs and career paths, and obsessing over topics/people/hobbies/foods—only for that obsession to disappear around the sixth month or when it stops giving me dopamine.</em></p>
<p>Getting a clinical diagnosis was important to me because it removed the second-guessing. Now, I can focus (so to speak) on my life and stop beating myself up for being who I am. They say the male ADHD brain finally matures at 35, and coincidentally, that’s when I got diagnosed.</p>
<p>I suggest checking out r/ADHD if you want more support since there are three types of ADHD: <em>Inattentive type, Hyperactive type, and Combined type.</em></p>
