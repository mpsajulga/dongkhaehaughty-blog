## Trigger Warning: Slightly Too Much Info Story Ahead

I’ve got a story that’s been sitting on the back burner lately. My cousin, **Kuya Ken**, invited me over to **Sheraton Cebu Mactan Resort**. He called me when I was just in the middle of my **immediate resignation at Amazon Cebu**. Since I had nothing going on at the time after resigning, I promptly got an **Angkas** to Mactan.  

I’ve already shared the bulk of the stay on Instagram/Facebook back then, but what I left was the interesting part. We were at **Savemore nearest Mactan airport** because Kuya Ken wanted to buy **pasalubong** for relatives in Davao.  

While we were at it, I got the urge to pee and asked Kuya Ken to wait with all the stuff at the **pasalubong aisle**. I asked for directions and quickly found it. As soon as I entered, I saw a man on the left urinal, so I went to the right urinal next to him since there was no third urinal in between.  

From what I understood about the **unspoken rules of peeing in the men’s CR** is that one goes in:

- Pees
- Jiggles the pee out (*Remember: "If you jiggle it more than 3 times, you're playing with it.")*
- Washes your hands afterward
- Looks into the mirror
- Dries your wet hands with your pants
- Uses the remaining moisture on your hair
- Winks at yourself
- Does the finger guns
- Gets out  

It should be a **30-second to 1-minute affair**. Eyes at your pecker while peeing, and no wandering eyes. If you’re unsure what to do, staring at the wall in front of you is a safe thing to do. **Anything that deviates from that will give you unusual looks.**  

> *I don't make the rules.*  

Anyway, from my peripheral vision, the other guy was doing something weird. **Grunting and doing something weird with his penis.** I thought he got it stuck on his pant zipper or maybe had kidney stones and therefore had trouble peeing properly. I didn’t look since it would deviate from what I understood to be the **rules of manhood**.  

Once I was finished with my business, I washed my hands and saw the guy in the mirror’s reflection and didn’t think anything else about it.  

Back to the **pasalubong aisle**, my cousin also had the urge to pee, so we switched places. I gave him instructions, reassured him I wouldn’t leave his baggage with his important documents, and then waved him away.  

Around **5 minutes** after using the restroom, I found **Kuya Ken with a face like he’d seen a ghost.**  

Here's the thing: **I totally missed it!** I was just focused on the task at hand, completely oblivious to the situation next door.  

Turns out, **the guy next to him in the restroom wasn’t exactly... "following the unwritten rules."** Let’s just say the guy was expressing himself **a little differently** than expected.

### Conversation in Bisaya:

> **Kuya Ken:** *Ko, kita ka atong lalake sa CR?*  
> (*Miko, did you see that guy in the CR?*)  
>
> **Me:** *Kato siya na dugay gapangihi? Naa pa siya diadto?*  
> (*The guy that’s been peeing for way too long? He’s still there?*)  
>
> **Kuya Ken:** *O, wala man to nangihi, wala man ka nagsaba na naay ga lo lo!?*  
> (*Yes, he wasn’t peeing actually. Why didn’t you say that he was masturbating?!*)  
>
> **Me:** *Ha, wala ko kabalo na ga inadto man diay siya. Murag ra man siya ug ga pass ug kidney stones.*  
> (*What? I didn’t know that he was doing that. He looked at me as though he was passing kidney stones.*)  
>
> **Kuya Ken:** *Ahak, lami kaayo ingnan ‘Naunsa diay ka bay’?!*  
> (*Damn, I wanted to say to him, “What the f*** is wrong with you?!”*)

He had a lot more **raunchy things to say**, but I don’t want this post to be as explicit as it could be. The **gist** was that he was **trauma-dumping in the guise of us laughing it off**. I was already **nearing a year in Cebu** and I was **numb** with how they **leave their mental cases naked in public**, so it **didn’t faze me as it should**.  

I couldn’t be so sure about my cousin, and that’s **his side of the story**.

The guy might’ve been on **drugs** and wasn’t aware of his surroundings. The guy might’ve **known we were there** and got his rocks off (*not kidney stones... haha*) based on that fact. **I don’t know really. It’s just a bunch of maybes.**  

And my cousin was asking **why I didn’t give him a heads-up.**  

We **tried** to give a heads-up to the **cashier/bagger**, but it sounded weird as we were saying it, so **we didn’t press into it as we should’ve.**  

The **guard?** Couldn’t even tell us straight that **Savemore is the Pasalubong Centre on Google Maps**.  

I mean, **we should’ve**, but **what’s the timeline of having to be witnesses for a sex deviant’s public masturbation criminal case?** My cousin’s got a **plane to catch.**

### Kidding aside...  

**What would you have done in this situation?**  

Would you have given your cousin a **heads-up**, or just **kept it moving like me?**  

(*Assuming that you would've also looked into the other guy's business.*)
